        <p>Why are you reading what's on my computer?
          Did you steal this computer?
          Are you looking at things you aren't supposed to?
          You know, it's not nice to look over someone's shoulder at someone else's work.
          Try asking to see what someone is up to, if you're interested in what's on their screen.
          However, what can I do? I'm just a message made by the owner of this computer
          as a warning against people who look at other people's stuff without permission.
          Feel free to ignore this paragraph.
